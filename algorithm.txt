The order of loading parameters:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) /usr/local/lib/vis-brain/lib.js
Prototypes for all standard mechanisms

2) ~/.vis-brain/lib.js
Prototypes for all user-defined mechanisms

3) ./project.js
Common parameters for the project. This script defines the world
object. All network will be created after recursive parse of the
world object.

4) The file denoted after '--model' key
Parameters for a certain task or a certain simulation stage

5) The JS code denoted after '--set' key

6) Then, the parameters will be recursively changed according to
JSON object containing after '--update' key



Loading mechanism machinery:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Each mechanism has name that looks like here:
stimulus:stationary.gif
stimulus - mechanism class
stationary - mechanism subclass (each mechanism can have different subclasses)
gif - mechanism name

Mechanism name shall be written in its description placed in .js object; field 'name'

Mechanism class is predefined by the program structure. The mechanisms belonging to unknown classes will not
be taken into consideration.

Defining the mechanism:
1) The program will call the method Stimulus::createStimulus("stationary.gif"). This in turn call the method
StationaryStimulus::createStimulus("gif") which in turn call the constructor GifStimulus()

2) In case of failure to find "gif" stimulus in the set of the standard mechanisms the program will create the object
ExternalStationaryStimulus("gif") which will in turn try to look for the file "stationary.gif.o"

3) In case of failure to find "stationary" in the set of the standard mechanisms the program will create the object
ExternalStimulus("stationary.gif") which will in turn try to look for the file "stationary.gif.o"






Where the program will find stationary.gif.o:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) as /usr/local/lib/vis-brain/mechanisms/stationary.gif.o
2) as ~/.vis-brain/stationary.gif.o
3) as ./.mechanisms/stationary.gif.o
4) if this doesn't help to find this file the program will be terminated with error







The order of loading the parameter description:
------------------------------------------------------------
The parameter description looks the same as parameter but each parameter contains object with the following key
instead of the certain value:
name - name of the parameter
type - type of the widget that is responsible for the parameter
refresh - true if one need to reload the parameters after their adding,
false if adding the line to the script is necessary
multiple - true for multiple values
default - the default value
description - detailed description of the parameter
constraint - the JS expression. If present, the parameters will be set only
when this expression returns true
values - in case when type == "LIST" this is an object with the following items:
item_1_id: item_1_name,
item_2_id: item_2_name
...
The other types are:
'string' - the string to input
'int' - integer
'float' - float number
'checkbox' - the checkbox
'file' - in case of stand-alone application the user need to select the file from
the hard disk drive. In case of client/server architecture the file will be
uploaded to the server and placed to the current folder
'colorpicker' - the field to pick the color

The description files influence only on the job of GUI. They are absolutely useless when starting the application
alone. The parameter description will find in the following files:

1) /usr/local/lib/vis-brain/description.js
2) ~/.vis-brain/description.js
3) ./.description.js

In case of failure to find the scalar parameter the parameter is treated to be hidden. In case of failure to find
the object parameter the object parameter is also treated as hidden.

Stages of assembling neural model
------------------------------------------------
1. create all children
2. Adjust children parameters:
2a. Create subchildren.
2b. Adjust common parameters.
2c. Compute the layer load
2d. Adjust parameters of subchildren
2e. Set the list of inputs and outputs
3. Estimate the computational load for
each matrix and for each connection
4. Normalize the total computational
load in such a way as their sum of total
number of all processes
5. Distribute the processes among the
network and assign the load to each
its element
6. Create matrix communicator, assign
each matrix communicator to the brain
layer
7. Split the nodes in each communication
graph into subnodes.
8. Join the nodes with the same rank
9. Create the output buffer for each
graph node
10. Create input buffer for each graph node
11. Create the input buffer for each graph node
12. Create input and output for each layer
13. Create the method (automatically creates
the initial state)
14. In the initial state, create all necessary
equations according to the method
15. Create the stimuli set and assign them to the layer
16. Create the analyzers and attach them to the layers
17. Simulate
